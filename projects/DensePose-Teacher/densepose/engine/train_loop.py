    A simple trainer for the most common type of task:
    single-cost single-optimizer single-data-source iterative optimization,
    optionally using data-parallelism.
    It assumes that every step, you:

    1. Compute the loss with a data from the data_loader.
    2. Compute the gradients with the above loss.
    3. Update the model with the optimizer.

    All other tasks during training (checkpointing, logging, evaluation, LR schedule)
    are maintained by hooks, which can be registered by :meth:`TrainerBase.register_hooks`.

    If you want to do anything fancier than this,
    either subclass TrainerBase and implement your own `run_step`,
    or write your own training loop.
